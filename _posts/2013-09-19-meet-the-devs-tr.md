display_title: Meet the Devs - TR Darr

{% include JB/setup %}

Thomas "TR" Darr is man of many hats at Toopher, working client-side on our mobile
apps and server-side on our API. He's a recent graduate from The
University of Texas, where he studied Chinese and linguistics and worked
developing Web applications for the faculty. He speaks four languages,
depending on your definition of "speaks." He enjoys television, but he's
probably never seen your favorite film. You wouldn't be the first person
to mistake his interest in something for wanton complaint.

When he's not carefully editing text files, you're most likely to find
him at his home in Brentwood with his wife and their two cats, or on
Twitter. Your life will be enriched if you follow him on Twitter, 
[@trdarr](https://twitter.com/trdarr), and on [GitHub](https://github.com/trdarr).
