# Announcing the Toopher Dev Blog

Toopher is changing the face of security by making two-factor authentication usable. Our initial solution uses your cell phone's location to automate requests from known-safe locations.

## What we do

We build cool stuff and love every minute of it.  We're working in various languages, including `Python`, `Objective C`, `PHP`, `.NET`, `Java`, `Ruby`, `JavaScript`, `Perl`, and `shell`. Future posts about our work are coming soon!

## Who we are

Started as a class project by Evan Grim, Toopher now has five developers. First, Toopher picked up Drew Shafer and two interns: TR Darr and Mike Wham. TR started full-time when another full-timer, Seth Holloway, started. You can find the official bios on the [Toopher site](https://www.toopher.com/).  

## Where we work

We work just south of the UT campus, in a room with a beautiful view of
West Austin. During the week you can find us designing, coding, and
having fun in a team room. And if it's a Blues on the Green night,
you're liable to find us on the Green.
