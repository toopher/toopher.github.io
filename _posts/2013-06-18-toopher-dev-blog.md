# Announcing the Toopher Dev Blog

## Who we are

Started as a class project by Evan Grim, Toopher now has five developers. First, Toopher
picked up Drew Shafer and two interns: TR Darr and Mike Wham. TR started full-time when another full-timer, Seth Holloway, started. You can find the official bios on the [Toopher site](https://www.toopher.com/).

## What we do

Toopher is changing the face of security by making two-factor
authentication usable. Our initial solution uses your cell phone's
location to automate requests from known-safe locations.

We're working in various languages, including Python, Objective C, PHP, .NET, Java, Ruby,
JavaScript, Perl, and shell. Future posts about our work are coming soon!

## Where we work

We work just south of the UT campus, in a room with a beautiful view of
West Austin. During the week you can find us designing, coding, and
having fun in a team room.
