# Toopher is hiring!

## Who we are

We're “invisible multifactor authentication as a service," and we're
looking for
full-time software engineers and interns to join our team in Austin,
Texas.

Technically, we're a Python API built in Django and hosted on Google App
Engine.
We have mobile apps for iOS and Android and a set of language libraries
in a
bunch of different languages: right now, it's Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl,
Java,
and C#. We also have a host of service integrations that are built from
those
libraries.

## Who you are

https://twitter.com/alex_gaynor/status/431822158809935872

You're interested in engineering high-quality software and you hopefully
have
opinions about what “high-quality software” means. You like the idea of
owning
projects from conception to deployment and having a lot of flexibility
and
creative control over them. You enjoy learning and picking up new skills
as
needed; because you're joining a small team, you'll be wearing a lot of
hats.

* We're looking for a **generalist** to expand engineering bandwidth.
  (We'd call
this “horizontal scaling,” but we don't want to imply that you're
commodity
hardware.)

* We're looking for a **user advocate** to remind us to zoom out and
  make sure
that we're engineering with usability in mind. It's really easy to get
attached
to code you've written!

* We're looking for a **finisher** as described by [Jacques
  Mattheij][jm],
“the person who crosses every *t* and dots every *i* in order to get the
last
10% … of a project done.”

If any of that seems interesting to you, apply! If you don't feel like
you're a
perfect fit, apply! Our goal is to hire the best people, and the best
people
can learn new skills.

## What we offer

Future Toopherarians can expect to receive competitive compensation as
salary
and equity as well as medical and dental insurance, but there're also
other
perks to joining our team, such as:

* a **flexible schedule**! Nine-to-fivers are welcome, but we don't
  count hours.
* **working from home**! We sometimes work completely virtually with
  [Slack][].
* your favorite **snacks and drinks**!
* **gym access**! there's one in our office building.
* your favorite **extracurricular activity**. We often share meals and
  go off-site for fun and games.

Is something missing? Let us know! This isn't an exhaustive list. We're
a
growing company, so we haven't figured everything out yet, but employee
happiness is super important to us and we want to do everything that we
can to
make it happen.

## Next steps

Send an introduction and a copy of your résumé to
[jobs@toopher.com][e-mail] and
let's get started!

If you'd like, you can fill out [our online version][survey] of Sijin
Joseph's
[Programmer Competency Matrix][pcm] and you're strongly encouraged to
include a
short code sample that you're particularly proud of, preferably with
some
context: what you did, why you did it, how you'd do it differently, etc.

If we like what we see, we'll bring you in for an interview. You
probably don't
need to spend a lot of time studying for this one—we're not going to
quiz you
about easily-googleable algorithmic trivia. We're more interested in
*you*:
how well you're able to solve problems and communicate their solutions.
